    At WellNest Clinics, we are committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of your personal

    contact information, insurance type, and medical history for the sole purpose of providing safe and
    effective healthcare services.

    We will never sell or disclose your information to unauthorized third parties. Information may only
    be shared with healthcare providers directly involved in your care, or as required by law. All data
    is stored securely using industry‑standard safeguards, and access is restricted to authorized staff
    who are trained in patient privacy practices.

    Your information is used to create and maintain accurate medical records, schedule appointments,
    process billing and insurance claims, and ensure continuity of care. We may also use non‑identifiable
    data for quality improvement, research, and reporting purposes, but such data cannot be traced back
    to you personally.

    By completing this form, you acknowledge that you understand how your information will be used and
    protected. You have the right to request access to your records, ask for corrections, and withdraw
    consent for certain uses at any time. If you choose not to provide the required information, some services
    may be limited.
